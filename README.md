Summary:

This project led me to explore a lot more with python. I started trying to scrape the table data using beautiful soup, however I came into an issue where most of the source code was hidden within javascript. So trying to explore more options, went for using Selenium which I knew about but never used before.
The complete project was donw with the help of the following modules :
-pandas: for creating the dataframe.
-googletrans: for translating the chinese characters.
-selenium: for automating through browser and extracting data.
-sqlalchemy: for connecting sql with python.
